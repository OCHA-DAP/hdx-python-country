The HDX Python Country Library provides utilities to map between country and region
codes and names and to match administrative level names from different sources.
It also provides utilities for foreign exchange enabling obtaining current and historic
FX rates for different currencies.

It provides country mappings including ISO 2 and ISO 3 letter codes (ISO 3166) and regions
using live official data from the [UN OCHA](https://vocabulary.unocha.org/) feed with
fallbacks to an internal static file if there is any problem with retrieving data from
the url. (Also it is possible to force the use of the internal static files.)

It can exact match English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Arabic. There is a
fuzzy matching for English look up that can handle abbreviations in country names like
Dem. for Democratic and Rep. for Republic.

Mapping administration level names from a source to a given base set is also handled
including phonetic fuzzy name matching.

It also provides foreign exchange rates and conversion from amounts in local
currency to USD and vice-versa. The conversion relies on Yahoo Finance, falling
back on [currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api) for current rates, and Yahoo Finance falling back
on IMF data via IATI (with interpolation) for historic daily rates.

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://hdx-python-country.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)
(HDX) project. If you have humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to
HDX.

## Development

### Environment

Development is currently done using Python 3.12. We recommend using a virtual
environment such as ``venv``:

```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```

In your virtual environment, install all packages for development by running:

```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pre-commit

Be sure to install `pre-commit`, which is run every time you make a git commit:

```shell
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
```

With pre-commit, all code is formatted according to
[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) guidelines.

To check if your changes pass pre-commit without committing, run:

```shell
    pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

Ensure you have the required packages to run the tests:

```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the tests and view coverage, execute:

```shell
    pytest -c --cov hdx
```

## Packages

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is used for package management.  If
youâ€™ve introduced a new package to the source code (i.e. anywhere in `src/`),
please add it to the `project.dependencies` section of `pyproject.toml` with
any known version constraints.

To add packages required only for testing, add them to the `test` section under
`[project.optional-dependencies]`.

Any changes to the dependencies will be automatically reflected in
`requirements.txt` with `pre-commit`, but you can re-generate the file without
committing by executing:

```shell
    pre-commit run pip-compile --all-files
```

## Project

[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) is used for project management. The project can be built using:

```shell
    hatch build
```

Linting and syntax checking can be run with:

```shell
    hatch fmt --check
```

Tests can be executed using:

```shell
    hatch test
```
